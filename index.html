        <p><em><strong>Tech Enthusiast and Software Engineer</strong></em></p>
        <p>I am an aspiring Cloud Developer passionate about learning, building, and empowering communities. I became the youngest teacher in an Italian-English Bilingual school and enjoyed teaching Math while I was still a junior at Baruch college. Then I started my journey in the tech field
          less than a year ago in my senior year by self-learning web development and the concepts of Cybersecurity. It was a wonderful experience volunteering and training college students about computer security topics and hands-on practices as a technical program manager for
          CodePath. I was the founder and the director of the technology committee for the Baruch Association for Information Systems. I enjoy traveling and immersing myself in a new culture, especially trying different cuisines. I also play my
          acoustic
          sometimes.</p>
